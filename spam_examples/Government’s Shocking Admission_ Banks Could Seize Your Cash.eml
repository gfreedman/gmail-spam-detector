An alphabet is a standardized set of basic written graphemes (called letter=
s)=20
representing phonemes, units of sounds that distinguish words, of certain=
=20
spoken languages.[1] Not =D0=B0ll writing systems represent language in thi=
s way; in=20
a syllabary, each character represents a syllable, and logographic systems =
use=20
characters to represent words, morphemes, or other semantic units.[2][3] Th=
e=20
Egyptians have created the first alphabet in a technical sense.[4] The shor=
t=20
uniliteral signs are used to write pronunciation guides for logograms, or a=
=20
character that represents a word, or morpheme, and later on, being used to=
=20
write foreign words.[5] This was used up to the 5th century AD.[6] The firs=
t=20
fully phonemic script, the Proto-Sinaitic script, which developed into the=
=20
Phoenician alphabet, is considered to be the first alphabet and is the ance=
stor=20
of most modern alphabets, abjads, and abugidas, including Arabic, Cyrillic,=
=20
Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and possibly Brahmic.[7][8] It was created by=20
Semitic-speaking workers and slaves in the Sinai Peninsula in modern-day Eg=
ypt,=20
by selecting a small number of hieroglyphs commonly seen in their Egyptian=
=20
surroundings to describe the sounds, as opposed to the semantic values of t=
he=20
Canaanite languages.[9][10] The Phoenician alphabet with corresponding Lati=
n=20
letters Peter T. Daniels distinguishes an abugida, a set of graphemes that=
=20
represent consonantal base letters that diacritics modify to represent vowe=
ls,=20
like in Devanagari and other South Asian scripts, an abjad, in which letter=
s=20
predominantly or exclusively represent consonants such as the original=20
Phoenician, Hebrew or Arabic, and an alphabet, a set of graphemes that=20
represent both consonants and vowels. In this narrow sense of the word, the=
=20
first true alphabet was the Greek alphabet,[11][12] which was based on the=
=20
earlier Phoenician abjad. Alphabets are usually associated with a standard=
=20
ordering of letters. This makes them useful for purposes of collation, whic=
h=20
allows words to be sorted in a specific =D0=BErder, commonly known as the=
=20
alphabetical =D0=BErder. It also means that their letters can be used as an=
=20
alternative method of "numbering" ordered items, in such contexts as number=
ed=20
lists and number placements. There are also names for letters in some=20
languages. This is known as acrophony; It is present in some modern scripts=
,=20
such as Greek, and many Semitic scripts, such as Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac=
. It=20
was used in some ancient alphabets, such as in Phoenician. However, this sy=
stem=20
is not present in =D0=B0ll languages, such as the Latin alphabet, which add=
s a vowel=20
after a character for each letter. Some systems also used to have this syst=
em=20
but later on abandoned it for a system similar to Latin, such as Cyrillic.=
=20
Etymology The English word alphabet came into Middle English from the Late=
=20
Latin word alphabetum, which in turn originated in the Greek, =E1=BC=80=CE=
=BB=CF=86=CE=AC=CE=B2=CE=B7=CF=84=CE=BF=CF=82=20
(alph=C3=A1b=C4=93tos); it was made from the first two letters of the Greek=
 alphabet,=20
alpha (=CE=B1) and beta (=CE=B2).[13] The names for the Greek letters, in t=
urn, came from=20
the first two letters of the Phoenician alphabet: aleph, the word for ox, a=
nd=20
bet, the word for house.[14] History Main article: History of the alphabet=
=20
Ancient Near Eastern alphabets The Ancient Egyptian writing system had a se=
t of=20
some 24 hieroglyphs that are called uniliterals,[15] which are glyphs that=
=20
provide one sound.[16] These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for=
=20
logograms, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe l=D0=
=BEan=20
words and foreign names.[5] The script was used a fair amount in the 4th=20
century CE.[17] However, after pagan temples were closed down, it was forgo=
tten=20
in the 5th century until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone.[6] There was a=
lso=20
the Cuneiform script. The script was used to write several ancient language=
s.=20
However, it was primarily used to write Sumerian.[18] The last known use of=
 the=20
Cuneiform script was in 75 CE, after which the script fell out of use.[19] =
In=20
the Middle Bronze Age, an apparently "alphabetic" system known as the=20
Proto-Sinaitic script appeared in Egyptian turquoise mines in the Sinai=20
peninsula dated c. 15th century BCE, apparently left by Canaanite workers. =
In=20
1999, John and Deborah Darnell, American Egyptologists, discovered an earli=
er=20
version of this first alphabet at the Wadi el-Hol valley in Egypt. The scri=
pt=20
dated to c. 1800 BCE and shows evidence of having been adapted from specifi=
c=20
forms of Egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to c. 2000 BCE, strongly=
=20
suggesting that the first alphabet had developed about that time.[20] The=
=20
script was based on letter appearances and names, believed to be based on=
=20
Egyptian hieroglyphs.[7] This script had no characters representing vowels.=
=20
Originally, it probably was a syllabary=E2=80=94a script where syllables ar=
e=20
represented with characters=E2=80=94with symbols that were not needed being=
 removed.=20
The b=D0=B5st-attested Bronze Age alphabet is Ugaritic, invented in Ugarit =
(Syria)=20
before the 15th century BCE. This was an alphabetic cuneiform script with 3=
0=20
signs, including three that indicate the following vowel. This script was n=
ot=20
used after the destruction of Ugarit in 1178 BCE.[21] A specimen of=20
Proto-Sinaitic script, one of the earliest (if not the very first) phonemic=
=20
scripts The Proto-Sinaitic script eventually developed into the Phoenician=
=20
alphabet, conventionally called "Proto-Canaanite" before c. 1050 BCE.[8] Th=
e=20
oldest text in Phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of Ki=
ng=20
Ahiram c. 1000 BCE. This script is the parent script of =D0=B0ll western al=
phabets.=20
By the tenth century BCE, two other forms distinguish themselves, Canaanite=
 and=20
Aramaic. The Aramaic gave rise to the Hebrew script.[22] The South Arabian=
=20
alphabet, a sister script to the Phoenician alphabet, is the script from wh=
ich=20
the Ge'ez alphabet, an abugida, a writing system where consonant-vowel=20
sequences are written as units, which was used around the horn of Africa,=
=20
descended. Vowel-less alphabets are called abjads, currently exemplified in=
=20
others such as Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac. The omission of vowels was not=
=20
always a satisfactory solut=D1=96on due to the need of preserving sacred te=
xts.=20
"Weak" consonants are used to indicate vowels. These letters have a dual=20
function since they can also be used as pure consonants.[23][24] The=20
Proto-Sinaitic script and the Ugaritic script were the first scripts with a=
=20
l=D1=96mited number of signs instead of using many different signs for word=
s, in=20
contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time, Cuneiform,=
=20
Egyptian hieroglyphs, and Linear B. The Phoenician script was probably the=
=20
first phonemic script,[7][8] and it contained =D0=BEnly about two dozen dis=
tinct=20
letters, making it a script simple enough for traders to learn. Another=20
advantage of the Phoenician alphabet was that it could write different=20
languages since it recorded words phonemically.[25] The Phoenician script w=
as=20
spread across the Mediterranean by the Phoenicians.[8] The Greek Alphabet w=
as=20
the first alphabet in which vowels have independent letter forms separate f=
rom=20
those of consonants. The Greeks chose letters representing sounds that did =
not=20
exist in Phoenician to represent vowels. The syllabical Linear B, a script =
that=20
was used by the Mycenaean Greeks from the 16th century BCE, had 87 symbols,=
=20
including five vowels. In its early years, there were many variants of the=
=20
Greek alphabet, causing many different alphabets to evolve from it.[26]=20
European alphabets The Greek alphabet, in Euboean f=D0=BErm, was carried ov=
er by=20
Greek colonists to the Italian peninsula circa 800-600 BCE giving rise to m=
any=20
different alphabets used to write the Italic languages, like the Etruscan=
=20
alphabet.[27] One of these became the Latin alphabet, which spread across=
=20
Europe as the Romans expanded their republic. After the fall of the Western=
=20
Roman Empire, the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works. It=
=20
came to be used for the descendant languages of Latin (the Romance language=
s)=20
and most of the other languages of western and central Europe. T=D0=BEday, =
it is the=20
most widely used script in the world.[28] The Etruscan alphabet remained ne=
arly=20
unchanged for several hundred years. =D0=9Enly evolving once the Etruscan l=
anguage=20
changed itself. The letters used for non-existent phonemes were dropped.[29=
]=20
Afterwards, however, the alphabet went through many different changes. The=
=20
final classical f=D0=BErm of Etruscan contained 20 letters. Four of them ar=
e vowels=20
(a, e, i, and u). Six fewer letters than the earlier forms. The script in i=
ts=20
classical f=D0=BErm was used until the 1st century CE. The Etruscan languag=
e itself=20
was not used in imperial Rome, but the script was used for religious texts.=
[30]=20
Some adaptations of the Latin alphabet have ligatures, a combination of two=
=20
letters make one, such as =C3=A6 in Danish and Icelandic and =C8=A2 in Algo=
nquian;=20
borrowings from other alphabets, such as the thorn =C3=BE in Old English an=
d=20
Icelandic, which came from the Futhark runes;[31] and modified existing=20
letters, such as the eth =C3=B0 of Old English and Icelandic, which is a mo=
dified d.=20
Other alphabets =D0=BEnly use a subset of the Latin alphabet, such as Hawai=
ian and=20
Italian, which uses the letters j, k, x, y, and w =D0=BEnly in foreign word=
s.[32]=20
Another notable script is Elder Futhark, believed to have evolved out of on=
e of=20
the Old Italic alphabets. Elder Futhark gave rise to other alphabets known=
=20
collectively as the Runic alphabets. The Runic alphabets were used for Germ=
anic=20
languages from 100 CE to the late Middle Ages, being engraved on stone and=
=20
jewelry, although inscriptions found on bone and wood occasionally appear.=
=20
These alphabets have since been replaced with the Latin alphabet. The excep=
tion=20
was for decorative use, where the runes remained in use until the 20th=20
century.[33] A photo of the Old Hungarian script. The Old Hungarian script =
was=20
the writing system of the Hungarians. It was in use during the entire histo=
ry=20
of Hungary, albeit not as an official writing system. From the 19th century=
, it=20
once again became more and more popular.[34] The Glagolitic alphabet was th=
e=20
initial script of the liturgical language Old Church Slavonic and became,=
=20
together with the Greek uncial script, the basis of the Cyrillic script.=20
Cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts and is=20
notable for its use in Slavic languages and also for other languages within=
 the=20
former Soviet Union. Cyrillic alphabets include Serbian, Macedonian, Bulgar=
ian,=20
Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian. The Glagolitic alphabet is believed to =
have=20
been created by Saints Cyril and Methodius, while the Cyrillic alphabet was=
=20
created by Clement of Ohrid, their disciple. They feature many letters that=
=20
appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by Greek and Hebrew.[35] As=
ian=20
alphabets Beyond the logographic Chinese writing, many phonetic scripts exi=
st=20
in Asia. The Arabic alphabet, Hebrew alphabet, Syriac alphabet, and other=
=20
abjads of the Middle East are developments of the Aramaic alphabet.[36][37]=

Most alphabetic scripts of India and Eastern Asia descend from the Brahmi=
=20
script, believed to be a descendant of Aramaic.[38] Hangul In Korea, Sejong=
 the=20
Gr=D0=B5at created the Hangul alphabet in 1443 CE.[39] Hangul is a unique a=
lphabet:=20
it is a featural alphabet, where the design of many of the letters comes fr=
om a=20
sound's place of articulation, like P looking like the widened mouth and L=
=20
looking like the tongue pulled in.[40] The creation of Hangul was planned b=
y=20
the government of the day,[41] and it places individual letters in syllable=
=20
clusters with equal dimensions, in the same way as Chinese characters. This=
=20
change allows for mixed-script writing, where one syllable always takes up =
one=20
type space no matter how many letters g=D0=B5t stacked into building that o=
ne=20
sound-block.[42] Zhuyin Zhuyin, sometimes referred to as Bopomofo, is a=20
semi-syllabary. It transcribes Mandarin phonetically in the Republic of Chi=
na.=20
After the later establishment of the People's Republic of China and its=20
adoption of Hanyu Pinyin, the use of Zhuyin t=D0=BEday is lim=D1=96ted. How=
ever, it is=20
still widely used in Taiwan. Zhuyin developed from a f=D0=BErm of Chinese s=
horthand=20
based on Chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an=
=20
alphabet and a syllabary. Like an alphabet, the phonemes of syllable initia=
ls=20
are represented by individual symbols, but like a syllabary, the phonemes o=
f=20
the syllable finals are not; each possible final (excluding the medial glid=
e)=20
has its own character, an example being luan written as =E3=84=8C=E3=84=A8=
=E3=84=A2 (l-u-an). The last=20
symbol =E3=84=A2 takes place as the entire final -an. While Zhuyin is not a=
 mainstream=20
writing system, it is still often used in ways similar to a romanization=20
system, for aiding pronunciation and as an input method for Chinese charact=
ers=20
on computers and cellphones.[43] Romanization European alphabets, especiall=
y=20
Latin and Cyrillic, have been adapted for many languages of Asia. Arabic is=
=20
also widely used, sometimes as an abjad, as with Urdu and Persian, and=20
sometimes as a complete alphabet, as with Kurdish and Uyghur.[44][45] Types=

"alphabet" is used by linguists and paleographers in both a wide and a narr=
ow=20
sense. In a broader sense, an alphabet is a segmental script at the phoneme=
=20
level=E2=80=94that is, it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not=
 for larger=20
units such as syllables or words. In the narrower sense, some scholars=20
distinguish "true" alphabets from two other types of segmental script, abja=
ds,=20
and abugidas. These three differ in how they treat vowels. Abjads have lett=
ers=20
for consonants and leve most vowels unexpressed. Abugidas are also=20
consonant-based but indicate vowels with diacritics, a systematic graphic=
=20
modification of the consonants.[46] The earliest known alphabet using this=
=20
sense is the Wadi el-Hol script, believed to be an abjad. Its successor,=20
Phoenician, is the ancestor of modern alphabets, including Arabic, Greek, L=
atin=20
(via the Old Italic alphabet), Cyrillic (via the Greek alphabet), and Hebre=
w=20
(via Aramaic).[47][48] A Venn diagram showing the Greek (left), Cyrillic=20
(bottom) and Latin (right) alphabets, which share many of the same letters,=
=20
although they have different pronunciations Examples of present-day abjads =
are=20
the Arabic and Hebrew scripts;[49] true alphabets include Latin, Cyrillic, =
and=20
Korean Hangul; and abugidas, used to write Tigrinya, Amharic, Hindi, and Th=
ai.=20
The Canadian Aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida, rather than a syllab=
ary,=20
as their nam=D0=B5 would imply, because each glyph stands for a consonant a=
nd is=20
modified by rotation to represent the following vowel. In a true syllabary,=
=20
each consonant-vowel combination gets represented by a separate glyph.[50] =
=D0=90ll=20
three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs. Ugaritic, for example, i=
s=20
essentially an abjad but has syllabic letters for /=CA=94a, =CA=94i, =CA=94=
u/[51][52] These=20
are the =D0=BEnly times that vowels are indicated. Coptic has a letter for =
/ti/.[53]=20
Devanagari is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for ini=
tial=20
vowels, though some traditions use =E0=A4=85 as a zero consonant as the gra=
phic base=20
for such vowels.[54][55] The boundaries between the three types of segmenta=
l=20
scripts are not always clear-cut. For example, Sorani Kurdish is written in=
 the=20
Arabic script, which, when used for other languages, is an abjad.[56] In=20
Kurdish, writing the vowels is mandatory, and whole letters are used, so th=
e=20
script is a true alphabet. Other languages may use a Semitic abjad with for=
ced=20
vowel diacritics, effectively making them abugidas. On the other hand, the=
=20
Phagspa script of the Mongol Empire was based closely on the Tibetan abugid=
a,=20
but vowel marks are written after the preceding consonant rather than as=20
diacritic marks. Although short a is not written, as in the Indic abugidas,=
 The=20
source of the term "abugida," namely the Ge'ez abugida n=D0=BEw used for Am=
haric and=20
Tigrinya, has assimilated into their consonant modifications. It is no long=
er=20
systematic and must be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental=20
script. Even more extreme, the Pahlavi abjad eventually became logographic.=

;">An alphabet is a standardized set of basic written graphemes (called let=
ters) representing phonemes, units of sounds that distinguish words, of cer=
tain spoken languages.[1] Not =D0=B0ll writing systems represent language i=
n this way; in a syllabary, each character represents a syllable, and logog=
raphic systems use characters to represent words, morphemes, or other seman=
tic units.[2][3] The Egyptians have created the first alphabet in a technic=
al sense.[4] The short uniliteral signs are used to write pronunciation gui=
des for logograms, or a character that represents a word, or morpheme, and =
later on, being used to write foreign words.[5] This was used up to the 5th=
 century AD.[6] The first fully phonemic script, the Proto-Sinaitic script,=
 which developed into the Phoenician alphabet, is considered to be the firs=
t alphabet and is the ancestor of most modern alphabets, abjads, and abugid=
as, including Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and possibly Brahmic.=
[7][8] It was created by Semitic-speaking workers and slaves in the Sinai P=
eninsula in modern-day Egypt, by selecting a small number of hieroglyphs co=
mmonly seen in their Egyptian surroundings to describe the sounds, as oppos=
ed to the semantic values of the Canaanite languages.[9][10] The Phoenician=
 alphabet with corresponding Latin letters Peter T. Daniels distinguishes a=
n abugida, a set of graphemes that represent consonantal base letters that =
diacritics modify to represent vowels, like in Devanagari and other South A=
sian scripts, an abjad, in which letters predominantly or exclusively repre=
sent consonants such as the original Phoenician, Hebrew or Arabic, and an a=
lphabet, a set of graphemes that represent both consonants and vowels. In t=
his narrow sense of the word, the first true alphabet was the Greek alphabe=
t,[11][12] which was based on the earlier Phoenician abjad. Alphabets are u=
sually associated with a standard ordering of letters. This makes them usef=
ul for purposes of collation, which allows words to be sorted in a specific=
 =D0=BErder, commonly known as the alphabetical =D0=BErder. It also means t=
hat their letters can be used as an alternative method of "numbering" order=
ed items, in such contexts as numbered lists and number placements. There a=
re also names for letters in some languages. This is known as acrophony; It=
 is present in some modern scripts, such as Greek, and many Semitic scripts=
, such as Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac. It was used in some ancient alphabets=
, such as in Phoenician. However, this system is not present in =D0=B0ll la=
nguages, such as the Latin alphabet, which adds a vowel after a character f=
or each letter. Some systems also used to have this system but later on aba=
ndoned it for a system similar to Latin, such as Cyrillic. Etymology The En=
glish word alphabet came into Middle English from the Late Latin word alpha=
betum, which in turn originated in the Greek, =E1=BC=80=CE=BB=CF=86=CE=AC=
=CE=B2=CE=B7=CF=84=CE=BF=CF=82 (alph=C3=A1b=C4=93tos); it was made from the=
 first two letters of the Greek alphabet, alpha (=CE=B1) and beta (=CE=B2).=
[13] The names for the Greek letters, in turn, came from the first two lett=
ers of the Phoenician alphabet: aleph, the word for ox, and bet, the word f=
or house.[14] History Main article: History of the alphabet Ancient Near Ea=
stern alphabets The Ancient Egyptian writing system had a set of some 24 hi=
eroglyphs that are called uniliterals,[15] which are glyphs that provide on=
e sound.[16] These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms, =
to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe l=D0=BEan words=
 and foreign names.[5] The script was used a fair amount in the 4th century=
 CE.[17] However, after pagan temples were closed down, it was forgotten in=
 the 5th century until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone.[6] There was als=
o the Cuneiform script. The script was used to write several ancient langua=
ges. However, it was primarily used to write Sumerian.[18] The last known u=
se of the Cuneiform script was in 75 CE, after which the script fell out of=
 use.[19] In the Middle Bronze Age, an apparently "alphabetic" system known=
 as the Proto-Sinaitic script appeared in Egyptian turquoise mines in the S=
inai peninsula dated c. 15th century BCE, apparently left by Canaanite work=
ers. In 1999, John and Deborah Darnell, American Egyptologists, discovered =
an earlier version of this first alphabet at the Wadi el-Hol valley in Egyp=
t. The script dated to c. 1800 BCE and shows evidence of having been adapte=
d from specific forms of Egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to c. 200=
0 BCE, strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had developed about that=
 time.[20] The script was based on letter appearances and names, believed t=
o be based on Egyptian hieroglyphs.[7] This script had no characters repres=
enting vowels. Originally, it probably was a syllabary=E2=80=94a script whe=
re syllables are represented with characters=E2=80=94with symbols that were=
 not needed being removed. The b=D0=B5st-attested Bronze Age alphabet is Ug=
aritic, invented in Ugarit (Syria) before the 15th century BCE. This was an=
 alphabetic cuneiform script with 30 signs, including three that indicate t=
he following vowel. This script was not used after the destruction of Ugari=
t in 1178 BCE.[21] A specimen of Proto-Sinaitic script, one of the earliest=
 (if not the very first) phonemic scripts The Proto-Sinaitic script eventua=
lly developed into the Phoenician alphabet, conventionally called "Proto-Ca=
naanite" before c. 1050 BCE.[8] The oldest text in Phoenician script is an =
inscription on the sarcophagus of King Ahiram c. 1000 BCE. This script is t=
he parent script of =D0=B0ll western alphabets. By the tenth century BCE, t=
wo other forms distinguish themselves, Canaanite and Aramaic. The Aramaic g=
ave rise to the Hebrew script.[22] The South Arabian alphabet, a sister scr=
ipt to the Phoenician alphabet, is the script from which the Ge'ez alphabet=
, an abugida, a writing system where consonant-vowel sequences are written =
as units, which was used around the horn of Africa, descended. Vowel-less a=
lphabets are called abjads, currently exemplified in others such as Arabic,=
 Hebrew, and Syriac. The omission of vowels was not always a satisfactory s=
olut=D1=96on due to the need of preserving sacred texts. "Weak" consonants =
are used to indicate vowels. These letters have a dual function since they =
can also be used as pure consonants.[23][24] The Proto-Sinaitic script and =
the Ugaritic script were the first scripts with a l=D1=96mited number of si=
gns instead of using many different signs for words, in contrast to the oth=
er widely used writing systems at the time, Cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs=
, and Linear B. The Phoenician script was probably the first phonemic scrip=
t,[7][8] and it contained =D0=BEnly about two dozen distinct letters, makin=
g it a script simple enough for traders to learn. Another advantage of the =
Phoenician alphabet was that it could write different languages since it re=
corded words phonemically.[25] The Phoenician script was spread across the =
Mediterranean by the Phoenicians.[8] The Greek Alphabet was the first alpha=
bet in which vowels have independent letter forms separate from those of co=
nsonants. The Greeks chose letters representing sounds that did not exist i=
n Phoenician to represent vowels. The syllabical Linear B, a script that wa=
s used by the Mycenaean Greeks from the 16th century BCE, had 87 symbols, i=
ncluding five vowels. In its early years, there were many variants of the G=
reek alphabet, causing many different alphabets to evolve from it.[26] Euro=
pean alphabets The Greek alphabet, in Euboean f=D0=BErm, was carried over b=
y Greek colonists to the Italian peninsula circa 800-600 BCE giving rise to=
 many different alphabets used to write the Italic languages, like the Etru=
scan alphabet.[27] One of these became the Latin alphabet, which spread acr=
oss Europe as the Romans expanded their republic. After the fall of the Wes=
tern Roman Empire, the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious work=
s. It came to be used for the descendant languages of Latin (the Romance la=
nguages) and most of the other languages of western and central Europe. T=
=D0=BEday, it is the most widely used script in the world.[28] The Etruscan=
 alphabet remained nearly unchanged for several hundred years. =D0=9Enly ev=
olving once the Etruscan language changed itself. The letters used for non-=
existent phonemes were dropped.[29] Afterwards, however, the alphabet went =
through many different changes. The final classical f=D0=BErm of Etruscan c=
ontained 20 letters. Four of them are vowels (a, e, i, and u). Six fewer le=
tters than the earlier forms. The script in its classical f=D0=BErm was use=
d until the 1st century CE. The Etruscan language itself was not used in im=
perial Rome, but the script was used for religious texts.[30] Some adaptati=
ons of the Latin alphabet have ligatures, a combination of two letters make=
 one, such as =C3=A6 in Danish and Icelandic and =C8=A2 in Algonquian; borr=
owings from other alphabets, such as the thorn =C3=BE in Old English and Ic=
elandic, which came from the Futhark runes;[31] and modified existing lette=
rs, such as the eth =C3=B0 of Old English and Icelandic, which is a modifie=
d d. Other alphabets =D0=BEnly use a subset of the Latin alphabet, such as =
Hawaiian and Italian, which uses the letters j, k, x, y, and w =D0=BEnly in=
 foreign words.[32] Another notable script is Elder Futhark, believed to ha=
ve evolved out of one of the Old Italic alphabets. Elder Futhark gave rise =
to other alphabets known collectively as the Runic alphabets. The Runic alp=
habets were used for Germanic languages from 100 CE to the late Middle Ages=
, being engraved on stone and jewelry, although inscriptions found on bone =
and wood occasionally appear. These alphabets have since been replaced with=
 the Latin alphabet. The exception was for decorative use, where the runes =
remained in use until the 20th century.[33] A photo of the Old Hungarian sc=
ript. The Old Hungarian script was the writing system of the Hungarians. It=
 was in use during the entire history of Hungary, albeit not as an official=
 writing system. From the 19th century, it once again became more and more =
popular.[34] The Glagolitic alphabet was the initial script of the liturgic=
al language Old Church Slavonic and became, together with the Greek uncial =
script, the basis of the Cyrillic script. Cyrillic is one of the most widel=
y used modern alphabetic scripts and is notable for its use in Slavic langu=
ages and also for other languages within the former Soviet Union. Cyrillic =
alphabets include Serbian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Russian, Belarusian, and =
Ukrainian. The Glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by Sain=
ts Cyril and Methodius, while the Cyrillic alphabet was created by Clement =
of Ohrid, their disciple. They feature many letters that appear to have bee=
n borrowed from or influenced by Greek and Hebrew.[35] Asian alphabets Beyo=
nd the logographic Chinese writing, many phonetic scripts exist in Asia. Th=
e Arabic alphabet, Hebrew alphabet, Syriac alphabet, and other abjads of th=
e Middle East are developments of the Aramaic alphabet.[36][37] Most alphab=
etic scripts of India and Eastern Asia descend from the Brahmi script, beli=
eved to be a descendant of Aramaic.[38] Hangul In Korea, Sejong the Gr=D0=
=B5at created the Hangul alphabet in 1443 CE.[39] Hangul is a unique alphab=
et: it is a featural alphabet, where the design of many of the letters come=
s from a sound's place of articulation, like P looking like the widened mou=
th and L looking like the tongue pulled in.[40] The creation of Hangul was =
planned by the government of the day,[41] and it places individual letters =
in syllable clusters with equal dimensions, in the same way as Chinese char=
acters. This change allows for mixed-script writing, where one syllable alw=
ays takes up one type space no matter how many letters g=D0=B5t stacked int=
o building that one sound-block.[42] Zhuyin Zhuyin, sometimes referred to a=
s Bopomofo, is a semi-syllabary. It transcribes Mandarin phonetically in th=
e Republic of China. After the later establishment of the People's Republic=
 of China and its adoption of Hanyu Pinyin, the use of Zhuyin t=D0=BEday is=
 lim=D1=96ted. However, it is still widely used in Taiwan. Zhuyin developed=
 from a f=D0=BErm of Chinese shorthand based on Chinese characters in the e=
arly 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary. Like an al=
phabet, the phonemes of syllable initials are represented by individual sym=
bols, but like a syllabary, the phonemes of the syllable finals are not; ea=
ch possible final (excluding the medial glide) has its own character, an ex=
ample being luan written as =E3=84=8C=E3=84=A8=E3=84=A2 (l-u-an). The last =
symbol =E3=84=A2 takes place as the entire final -an. While Zhuyin is not a=
 mainstream writing system, it is still often used in ways similar to a rom=
anization system, for aiding pronunciation and as an input method for Chine=
se characters on computers and cellphones.[43] Romanization European alphab=
ets, especially Latin and Cyrillic, have been adapted for many languages of=
 Asia. Arabic is also widely used, sometimes as an abjad, as with Urdu and =
Persian, and sometimes as a complete alphabet, as with Kurdish and Uyghur.[=

th Indic South Indic Ethiopic Thaana Canadian syllabic History of the alpha=
bet vte The term "alphabet" is used by linguists and paleographers in both =
a wide and a narrow sense. In a broader sense, an alphabet is a segmental s=
cript at the phoneme level=E2=80=94that is, it has separate glyphs for indi=
vidual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words. In the n=
arrower sense, some scholars distinguish "true" alphabets from two other ty=
pes of segmental script, abjads, and abugidas. These three differ in how th=
ey treat vowels. Abjads have letters for consonants and leve most vowels un=
expressed. Abugidas are also consonant-based but indicate vowels with diacr=
itics, a systematic graphic modification of the consonants.[46] The earlies=
t known alphabet using this sense is the Wadi el-Hol script, believed to be=
 an abjad. Its successor, Phoenician, is the ancestor of modern alphabets, =
including Arabic, Greek, Latin (via the Old Italic alphabet), Cyrillic (via=
 the Greek alphabet), and Hebrew (via Aramaic).[47][48] A Venn diagram show=
ing the Greek (left), Cyrillic (bottom) and Latin (right) alphabets, which =
share many of the same letters, although they have different pronunciations=
 Examples of present-day abjads are the Arabic and Hebrew scripts;[49] true=
 alphabets include Latin, Cyrillic, and Korean Hangul; and abugidas, used t=
o write Tigrinya, Amharic, Hindi, and Thai. The Canadian Aboriginal syllabi=
cs are also an abugida, rather than a syllabary, as their nam=D0=B5 would i=
mply, because each glyph stands for a consonant and is modified by rotation=
 to represent the following vowel. In a true syllabary, each consonant-vowe=
l combination gets represented by a separate glyph.[50] =D0=90ll three type=
s may be augmented with syllabic glyphs. Ugaritic, for example, is essentia=
lly an abjad but has syllabic letters for /=CA=94a, =CA=94i, =CA=94u/[51][5=
2] These are the =D0=BEnly times that vowels are indicated. Coptic has a le=
tter for /ti/.[53] Devanagari is typically an abugida augmented with dedica=
ted letters for initial vowels, though some traditions use =E0=A4=85 as a z=
ero consonant as the graphic base for such vowels.[54][55] The boundaries b=
etween the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear-cut. For e=
xample, Sorani Kurdish is written in the Arabic script, which, when used fo=
r other languages, is an abjad.[56] In Kurdish, writing the vowels is manda=
tory, and whole letters are used, so the script is a true alphabet. Other l=
anguages may use a Semitic abjad with forced vowel diacritics, effectively =
making them abugidas. On the other hand, the Phagspa script of the Mongol E=
mpire was based closely on the Tibetan abugida, but vowel marks are written=
 after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks. Although sho=
rt a is not written, as in the Indic abugidas, The source of the term "abug=
ida," namely the Ge'ez abugida n=D0=BEw used for Amharic and Tigrinya, has =
assimilated into their consonant modifications. It is no longer systematic =
and must be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script. Even =
more extreme, the Pahlavi abjad eventually became logographic.[57]</p> </di=
