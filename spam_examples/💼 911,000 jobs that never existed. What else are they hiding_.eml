 And here's the proof:=20

 The federal government just eliminated 71,000 workers.=20

 * Treasury fraud detection: 500% improvement=20
 * IRS processing: Cut in HALF  That was the test case.=20

do you think corporations are doing?

 * Microsoft: 9,000 layoffs=20
 * Jamie Dimon: "AI will lead to massive layoffs"  But here's what nobody's=

talking about:

 While jobs disappear, $90 billion in government infrastructure spending is=

=E2=80=8A
What Is the Emoluments Clause? Written by Fact-checked by Amendments 1-10 t=
o=20
the Constitution of the United States constitute what is known as the Bill =
of=20
Rights on an American flag. =C2=A9 Comstock/Thinkstock The emoluments claus=
e, also=20
called the foreign emoluments clause, is a provision of the U.S. Constituti=
on=20
(Article I, Section 9, Paragraph 8) that generally prohibits federal=20
officeholders from receiving any gift, payment, or other object or service =
of=20
value from a foreign state or its rulers, officers, or representatives. The=
=20
clause provides that: No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United=
=20
States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, sha=
ll,=20
without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Offi=
ce,=20
or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State. Th=
e=20
Constitution also contains a =E2=80=9Cdomestic emoluments clause=E2=80=9D (=
Article II, Section=20
1, Paragraph 7), which prohibits the president from receiving any =E2=80=9C=
Emolument=E2=80=9D=20
from the federal government or the states beyond =E2=80=9Ca Compensation=E2=
=80=9D for his=20
=E2=80=9CServices=E2=80=9D as chief executive. geoff.c.freedman@gmail.com J=
an 11, 2026 21336190=20
The plain purpose of the foreign emoluments clause was to ensure that the=
=20
country=E2=80=99s leaders would not be improperly influenced, even unconsci=
ously,=20
through gift giving, then a common and generally corrupt practice among=20
European rulers and diplomats. An early version of the clause, modeled on a=
=20
rule adopted by the Dutch Republic in 1651 that forbade its foreign ministe=
rs=20
from receiving =E2=80=9Cany presents, directly or indirectly, in any manner=
 or way=20
whatever,=E2=80=9D was incorporated into the Articles of Confederation (178=
1) as=20
Article VI, Paragraph I: Nor shall any person holding any office of profit =
or=20
trust under the United States, or any of them, accept any present, emolumen=
t,=20
office or title of any kind whatever from any King, Prince or foreign State=
;=20
nor shall the United States in Congress assembled, or any of them, grant an=
y=20
title of nobility. All but the prohibition of titles of nobility was droppe=
d=20
from the initial draft of the Constitution but eventually restored at the=
=20
request of Charles Pinckney, who argued at the Constitutional Convention fo=
r=20
=E2=80=9Cthe necessity of preserving foreign Ministers & other officers of =
the U.S.=20
independent of foreign influence.=E2=80=9D The final text of the clause inc=
luded a=20
provision that permitted acceptance of foreign gifts with the explicit appr=
oval=20
of Congress, perhaps reflecting the awkward experience of Benjamin Franklin=
,=20
who as American minister to France had been presented with a bejeweled snuf=
f=20
box by Louis XVI and, not wishing to offend the king, asked Congress for=20
permission to keep it (permission was granted). geoff.c.freedman@gmail.com =
Jan=20
11, 2026 21336190 Although there has been some debate regarding the exact=
=20
meaning and scope of the foreign emoluments clause, nearly all scholars agr=
ee=20
that it applies broadly to all federal officeholders, appointed or elected,=
 up=20
to and including the president. That interpretation is supported by the=20
historical record, such as it is, of the Constitution=E2=80=99s drafting as=
 well as by=20
the past practice of presidential administrations and Congresses. Thus Edmu=
nd=20
Jennings Randolph, one of the Framers, remarked at the Virginia ratifying=
=20
convention that the clause protected against the danger of =E2=80=9Cthe Pre=
sident=20
receiving Emoluments from foreign powers,=E2=80=9D even asserting that a pr=
esident who=20
violates the clause =E2=80=9Cmay be impeached.=E2=80=9D There was no record=
ed dissent from=20
Randolph=E2=80=99s view. During the 19th and 20th centuries, presidents who=
 were=20
offered gifts by foreign states routinely requested Congress=E2=80=99s perm=
ission to=20
accept them, and foreign rulers were politely informed (sometimes by the=20
president himself) of the constitutional restriction regarding gifts.=20
geoff.c.freedman@gmail.com Jan 11, 2026 21336190 The foreign emoluments cla=
use=20
also broadly encompasses any kind of profit, benefit, advantage, or service=
,=20
not merely gifts of money or valuable objects. Thus, it would prohibit a=20
federal officeholder from receiving special consideration in business=20
transactions with a foreign state (or with a corporation owned or managed b=
y a=20
foreign state) that gave the officeholder a competitive advantage over othe=
r=20
businesses. Arguably, as the legal scholar Laurence Tribe and others have=
=20
suggested, the clause would forbid even competitively fair transactions wit=
h=20
foreign states, because the profit accruing to the officeholder would fall=
=20
within the ordinary meaning of =E2=80=9Cemolument,=E2=80=9D and because suc=
h arrangements would=20
threaten exactly the kind of improper influence that the emoluments clause =
was=20
intended to prevent.

to;">What Is the Emoluments Clause? Written by Fact-checked by Amendments 1=
-10 to the Constitution of the United States constitute what is known as th=
e Bill of Rights on an American flag. =C2=A9 Comstock/Thinkstock The emolum=
ents clause, also called the foreign emoluments clause, is a provision of t=
he U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 9, Paragraph 8) that generally pro=
hibits federal officeholders from receiving any gift, payment, or other obj=
ect or service of value from a foreign state or its rulers, officers, or re=
presentatives. The clause provides that: No Title of Nobility shall be gran=
ted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Tru=
st under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any pr=
esent, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Pr=
ince, or foreign State. The Constitution also contains a =E2=80=9Cdomestic =
emoluments clause=E2=80=9D (Article II, Section 1, Paragraph 7), which proh=
ibits the president from receiving any =E2=80=9CEmolument=E2=80=9D from the=
 federal government or the states beyond =E2=80=9Ca Compensation=E2=80=9D f=
or his =E2=80=9CServices=E2=80=9D as chief executive. geoff.c.freedman@gmai=
l.com Jan 11, 2026 21336190 The plain purpose of the foreign emoluments cla=
use was to ensure that the country=E2=80=99s leaders would not be improperl=
y influenced, even unconsciously, through gift giving, then a common and ge=
nerally corrupt practice among European rulers and diplomats. An early vers=
ion of the clause, modeled on a rule adopted by the Dutch Republic in 1651 =
that forbade its foreign ministers from receiving =E2=80=9Cany presents, di=
rectly or indirectly, in any manner or way whatever,=E2=80=9D was incorpora=
ted into the Articles of Confederation (1781) as Article VI, Paragraph I: N=
or shall any person holding any office of profit or trust under the United =
States, or any of them, accept any present, emolument, office or title of a=
ny kind whatever from any King, Prince or foreign State; nor shall the Unit=
ed States in Congress assembled, or any of them, grant any title of nobilit=
y. All but the prohibition of titles of nobility was dropped from the initi=
al draft of the Constitution but eventually restored at the request of Char=
les Pinckney, who argued at the Constitutional Convention for =E2=80=9Cthe =
necessity of preserving foreign Ministers & other officers of the U.S. inde=
pendent of foreign influence.=E2=80=9D The final text of the clause include=
d a provision that permitted acceptance of foreign gifts with the explicit =
approval of Congress, perhaps reflecting the awkward experience of Benjamin=
 Franklin, who as American minister to France had been presented with a bej=
eweled snuff box by Louis XVI and, not wishing to offend the king, asked Co=
ngress for permission to keep it (permission was granted). geoff.c.freedman=
@gmail.com Jan 11, 2026 21336190 Although there has been some debate regard=
ing the exact meaning and scope of the foreign emoluments clause, nearly al=
l scholars agree that it applies broadly to all federal officeholders, appo=
inted or elected, up to and including the president. That interpretation is=
 supported by the historical record, such as it is, of the Constitution=E2=
=80=99s drafting as well as by the past practice of presidential administra=
tions and Congresses. Thus Edmund Jennings Randolph, one of the Framers, re=
marked at the Virginia ratifying convention that the clause protected again=
st the danger of =E2=80=9Cthe President receiving Emoluments from foreign p=
owers,=E2=80=9D even asserting that a president who violates the clause =E2=
=80=9Cmay be impeached.=E2=80=9D There was no recorded dissent from Randolp=
h=E2=80=99s view. During the 19th and 20th centuries, presidents who were o=
ffered gifts by foreign states routinely requested Congress=E2=80=99s permi=
ssion to accept them, and foreign rulers were politely informed (sometimes =
by the president himself) of the constitutional restriction regarding gifts=
. geoff.c.freedman@gmail.com Jan 11, 2026 21336190 The foreign emoluments c=
lause also broadly encompasses any kind of profit, benefit, advantage, or s=
ervice, not merely gifts of money or valuable objects. Thus, it would prohi=
bit a federal officeholder from receiving special consideration in business=
 transactions with a foreign state (or with a corporation owned or managed =
by a foreign state) that gave the officeholder a competitive advantage over=
 other businesses. Arguably, as the legal scholar Laurence Tribe and others=
 have suggested, the clause would forbid even competitively fair transactio=
ns with foreign states, because the profit accruing to the officeholder wou=
ld fall within the ordinary meaning of =E2=80=9Cemolument,=E2=80=9D and bec=
ause such arrangements would threaten exactly the kind of improper influenc=
e that the emoluments clause was intended to prevent. </div></div></td></tr=
